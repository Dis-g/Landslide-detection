# Landslide Detection Project

This project is a web application designed to predict and visualize landslide susceptibility. It leverages machine learning models trained on geospatial data to identify high-risk areas and presents the findings in a user-friendly React-based interface.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Web Interface:** A user-friendly frontend built with React to display project information and results.
* **Data-Driven Prediction:** Utilizes machine learning models to analyze geospatial data for landslide risk.
* **Project Showcase:** Includes dedicated sections for methodology, tech stack, results, and an interactive demo (based on components like `Methodology.jsx`, `Results.jsx`, and `Demo.jsx`).
* **In-Depth Data Analysis:** Features an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook (`EDA.ipynb`) to document data insights.

## Dataset

The models in this project were trained on a geospatial dataset from **Darjeeling**. Key features used for analysis appear to be:
* **Elevation** (`Darjeeling_Elevation.tif`)
* **Slope** (`Darjeeling_Slope.tif`)

## Technology Stack

This project combines a modern frontend with a robust data science backend.

**Frontend:**
* **React**
* **Vite**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* JavaScript (JSX)
* HTML5 & CSS3

**Backend & Machine Learning:**
* **Python**
* **Pandas** & **NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
* **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM** (Modeling, inferred from tech stack icons)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (EDA)

**Data Visualization:**
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**
* (Potential use of Streamlit or Power BI indicated by icons)

**Tools:**
* **Git** & **GitHub**
